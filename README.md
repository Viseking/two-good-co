 using gsap and JavaScript 
I can create/update the README for Viseking/two-good-co. Do you want me to:

- Draft a README here for you to copy/paste, or
- Create and commit the README.md directly to the repository?

Also: do you want a simple generic README (project description, run instructions, credits, license placeholder), or should I inspect the repo to include specific file paths, build steps, screenshots, and a chosen license? If you want me to commit the file, confirm I should push to the Viseking/two-good-co repo.

Below is a ready-to-use README draft for a GSAP-based static HTML clone of togood.co. Tell me if you want edits or want me to commit it.

README draft:

Project title
two-good-co — GSAP-based static clone of togood.co

Short description
A GSAP-powered HTML/CSS/JS clone of the togood.co website. Built as a static site that reproduces the visual interactions and animations using GSAP.

Features
- GSAP animations and timeline-based interactions
- Responsive layout (desktop-first)
- Static HTML/CSS/JS — no framework required
- Assets and simple build/dev instructions

Quick demo
Open index.html in a browser or serve the folder with a local static server to see the animations.

Getting started (local)
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Viseking/two-good-co.git
2. Open index.html in your browser OR run a simple static server:
   - Python 3: python -m http.server 8000
   - Node (serve): npx serve .
3. Visit http://localhost:8000 (or appropriate port)

Notes about dependencies
- GSAP (included via script file or CDN). If the repo uses a bundled package.json/build, run npm install and the build step described below.

Build / development (optional)
- If this repo includes a package.json and build scripts:
  npm install
  npm run dev    # if there is a dev server
  npm run build  # if there is a production build step

Project structure (example)
- index.html — main HTML
- assets/css/ — styles
- assets/js/ — JS and GSAP scripts
- assets/images/ — images and icons

Customization
- Edit assets/js/main.js (or the relevant JS files) to modify GSAP timelines and interactions.
- Styles are in assets/css/*.css (or .scss if present).

Known differences
- This project is a clone and is intended for learning/demonstration. It does not claim ownership of the original togood.co design or assets.

Credits & license
- Clone of togood.co (design and original content belong to their respective owners).
- Please choose a license (e.g., MIT) and replace the LICENSE placeholder.

Contributing
- Open issues / PRs with improvements, bug fixes, or accessibility enhancements.
- Keep animations performant and fallback gracefully for reduced-motion preferences.

Would you like me to:
1) Modify this draft (add screenshot, adjust wording, pick a license)?
2) Inspect the repo to auto-fill file names and exact build steps?
3) Commit this README.md directly to main for you?
